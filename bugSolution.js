The solution involves using async/await to ensure that the snapshot has been fully loaded before accessing its properties.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import {db} from './firebaseConfig'; //Import your firebase config

async function getData() {
  try {
    const snapshot = await db.collection('yourCollection').doc('yourDoc').get();

    if (snapshot.exists()) {
      const data = snapshot.data();
      console.log(data.propertyName); // Access properties safely after data is loaded
    } else {
      console.log('No such document!');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

getData();
```

This revised code uses `async/await` to wait for the promise returned by `get()` to resolve. The code within the `try` block will execute only after the snapshot is fully populated.  Error handling is included using a `catch` block.
